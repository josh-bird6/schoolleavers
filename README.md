# School leavers in Scotland: An analysis
This repo contains documentation relating to a project analysing school leavers in Scotland.

The basis of this work and the analyses therein was a data-sharing agreement between the Scottish Funding Council and Skills Development Scotland. The results of this work were never made public. For that reason, all of the raw datasets, as well as briefing papers and most visuals, cannot be shared publicly.

Nevertheless, an assortment of different scripts - both in SAS and R - which outline the progression and analytical approach to this project can be found here
